# Chusu bot
Chusu-bot is a robot to assist vertical farms in the task of harvesting. It is being develop with the following scenario in mind:

A vertical farm composed of planting cells presenting a set of sensors, capable to measure humidity, temperature, maturation of the vegetable and other characteristics. There is a infrastructure to communicate these cells to a central station. Then, using that information, an offline planning algorithm needs to choose the cells with highest harvest score, while considering other objectives, such as distance and cargo capacity of the robot. Finally, a mobile robot manipulator with a forklift-like end effector takes the cell to its stack.

This repository consists of simulation codes, robot descriptions and worlds where the techiniques are being applied.
